            <h1>Languages used to create this website</h1>
            <p>This website is created using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but we aim to use PHP and Django or Flask frameworks of Python in the future to make our website better. But, for now, HTML is the main language where this website has been created, JavaScript has been used to add important functionality to the website such as logging in with the Username, creating room names and storing them in the database and displaying messages, and saving them in the database, so that all users can see the messages. CSS has been used to style the website!</p>
            <h1>Tools used in creating the websiete</h1>
            <p>Firebase is the main tool used to create this website. The room names and messages you can see on the screen are because of Google Firebase only. It is a database in which all these details are stored!
               <br>
               Github is another tool used in this website. Although Github is not really a tool, it has just been used to host this website with a link, so that anyone, anywhere in the world can access the website by just using the link.
               <br>
               The next tool used is VS-Code (Visual Studio Code). It is the platform where this website has been programmed, and made ready to be hosted in the link.
               <br>
               The next tool and perhaps the most important tool used to style this website is Bootstrap. It is an open-source library used to add stylings to the website to improve its UI and UX.
               <br>
               Although W3Schools is not a tool, actually it is a website, it has been used here to refer to codes to create the website.
               <br>
               JQuery is a feature-rich JavaScript library used in this website.
