            <h2>About KittyChat</h2>
            <p>So what exactly is KittyChat. In short words it is a messaging(in fact chatting) website where you can chat with your friends. To be more specific about the latest version, i.e. KittyChat 2.0, I have coded it such that first you need to sign in with a name, then you have to create a room name or join a public room to chat with different people! <br> And if you have doubts about what is KittyChat, the first version, it is kinda like this one save for there you don't have to create a room name and the verification badge does not appear automatically.</p>
