               <p>We have updated our website and tested different features, some of which showed negative results but all of the rest stuff are okay to use, the info page has been updated along with a new feature that everytime a new message comes the screen will automatically scroll to the bottom which was not the case for a long time! Our test of Dark-Light Mode failed but we are still trying to figure out the issue, also a new Email-Password based login system is being tested if it can be used! In that one you have to create an Account first and then Sign-In with that account! There won't be any problems because the previous messages won't get affected! Enjoy Version 4.2.1!</p>

               <p>Our website has been successfully updated, now you can use it propoerly, the database has been fixed and a link to go to our previous version, that is, LetsChat-1, has been embedded in the login page, hope you enjoy that version too, its not bad afterall, and the UI and UX of that version is many times higher than this version, but the problem is that version has only one chat room, also I am trying to add a few more features in the coming days! The previous version too shall be updated to a much better website.</p>
