               <h3>Community Update on 03/07/2023 12 Noon GMT.
               <p>Today we have started our Yearly Update 2023 and the first part took place today in which our Lets-Chat+ was released, it was the first and most basic version of Lets-Chat+ which shall be further updated in upcoming days, now many features are not added. You can also post suggestions as to what we can add in Lets-Chat+. When you open Lets-Chat+, it tells you that it is a Dual.ly and Lets-Chat joint venture. Now Dual.ly is a site developed by me long time back which you can visit <a href="https://saptarshi1104.github.io/dual.ly/">at this link</a> and also mroe features shall be added to Lets-Chat which include Community Updates Pings, etc and we are thinking of adding more CSS and JavaScript frameworks to make it much better! Also the Lets-Chat+ link has been updated in our "Historic Lets-Chat" tab.</p>

               <h3>Community Update on 25/12/2022 3:30 P.M GMT.
               <p>Today on Christmas Day, we have launched our new version called version 4.3.0 in which our starter page has been successfully added as well as our DataBase has been improved to a large extent such that it does not need update after 30 days and all messages to be deleted after 30 days. Now you can freely use our website with no fear of messages getting deleted. Also our Login-Signup System is under development and it is to inform you that it will be done in PHP Language and the Lets-Chat+ is ready. It shall be launched in the next update. But our Login-Signup System will still need some time and we expect it to be done by March 2023 or as late as June because it is being done in a different language and needs more testing and verification to prove that it really works! Merry Christmas Everyone!</p>

               <h3>Community Update on 20/08/2022 17:00 P.M GMT.
               <p>We have updated our website and tested different features, some of which showed negative results but all of the rest stuff are okay to use, the info page has been updated along with a new feature that everytime a new message comes the screen will automatically scroll to the bottom which was not the case for a long time! Our test of Dark-Light Mode failed but we are still trying to figure out the issue, also a new Email-Password based login system is being tested if it can be used! In that one you have to create an Account first and then Sign-In with that account! There won't be any problems because the previous messages won't get affected! Enjoy Version 4.2.1!</p>

               <p>Our website has been successfully updated, now you can use it propoerly, the database has been fixed and a link to go to our previous version, that is, LetsChat-1, has been embedded in the login page, hope you enjoy that version too, its not bad afterall, and the UI and UX of that version is many times higher than this version, but the problem is that version has only one chat room, also I am trying to add a few more features in the coming days! The previous version too shall be updated to a much better website.</p>
